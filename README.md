# Rename multiple files or a sequence o files...

This shell script was created to rename several files at once that have the same base name, but are enumerated some how (in order to differentiate each one).


## üí° Here are some tips on how to use it

<br>

Make sure the files are inside a directory along with the script file <i>rename_multiple_siles.sh</i>

<br>

Then, you can choose between three options to rename files, just change the value of the variable $RENAME_OPTION:

    ‚Ü™Ô∏è Rename files by enumerating them and keeping the same enumeration of the old files (RENAME_OPTION=1);

    ‚Ü™Ô∏è Rename files by enumerating them in ascending order, starting from the initial value of the variable $NUM
       with an increment as defined by the variable $NUM_INCREMENT (RENAME_OPTION=2);

    ‚Ü™Ô∏è Rename files by just replacing a part of the filename (RENAME_OPTION=3).

<br>

Now, you need to set the extension of the files that would be renamed in the variable $FILE_EXTENSION:

    e.g. FILE_EXTENSION=".dat" or FILE_EXTENSION=".png"

<br>

If you chose RENAME_OPTION=1 and RENAME_OPTION=2, you must define the complete name of the files,
including the enumeration format and the file extension, in the variable $NEW_COMPLETE_NAME:

    e.g. NEW_COMPLETE_NAME="my_new_filename_%02d.dat"

<br>

If you chose RENAME_OPTION=2, you must define the starting number and the increment of the file enumeration as previously described:

    e.g. NUM=1 and NUM_INCREMENT=1

<br>

If you chose RENAME_OPTION=3, you must set the part of the name you want to remove in the variable $RMV_NAME, and the part you want to include in the variable $INCL_NAME:

    e.g. RMV_NAME="old" and INCL_NAME="new"

<br>

‚òëÔ∏è After all, you can run the script.
